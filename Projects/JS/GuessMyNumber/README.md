## General Information
To create a guessing game, we want to write a application to pick a random variety between 1 and 10. To supply pointers to the user, we can use conditional statements to inform the consumer if the guessed range is smaller, increased than or equal to the randomly chosen number. 
If the guessed number is lower than the randomly chosen number, the user will see “It is smaller than ..”. If the guessed number is greater than the randomly chosen number, the person will see “It is larger than..”. When the person guesses the right number,“that's the number!!” and after how many tries the person guessed the number will be displayed in the output.
